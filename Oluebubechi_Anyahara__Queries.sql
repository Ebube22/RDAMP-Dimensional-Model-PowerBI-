Absolutely! Below is a **single SQL script** that contains all **5 reusable business insight queries**, each created as a **named SQL view**.

---

‚úÖ These views:
- Join `fact_sales` to relevant dimensions  
- Return strategic, reusable insights  
- Can be loaded directly into **Power BI** via ODBC  
- Are grouped logically with comments for clarity
